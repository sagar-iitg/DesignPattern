This implementation provides three rate limiting strategies:

Fixed Window Counter
Sliding Window Log
Token Bucket
The RateLimiter class uses the Strategy pattern,
allowing you to easily switch between different rate limiting algorithms.

Key points:

The RateLimitStrategy interface defines the contract for all rate limiting strategies.
Each strategy implementation (FixedWindowCounter, SlidingWindowLog, TokenBucket)
provides its own logic for rate limiting.
The RateLimiter class is configured with a specific strategy
and delegates the rate limiting decision to that strategy.
This implementation is thread-safe, using ConcurrentHashMap
and atomic operations where necessary. It's also designed to be efficient,
avoiding unnecessary object creation and using time-based expiration for old data.

To use a different strategy,
  you simply need to create a new RateLimiter instance with the desired strat
